Introduction
============

**NimYAML** is a pure YAML implementation for Nim. It is able to read from and
write to YAML character streams, and to serialize from and construct to native
Nim types. It exclusively supports
`YAML 1.2 <http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html>`_.

Source code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/flyx/NimYAML>`_. You can
install it with `Nimble <https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble>`_:

.. code-block:: bash
  nimble install yaml
