## Module yaml/stream
## ==================
##
## The stream API provides the basic data structure on which all low-level APIs
## operate. It is not named ``streams`` to not confuse it with the modle in the
## stdlib with that name.

    ## A ``YamlStream`` is an iterator-like object that yields a
    ## well-formed stream of ``YamlStreamEvents``. Well-formed means that
    ## every ``yamlStartMap`` is terminated by a ``yamlEndMap``, every
    ## ``yamlStartSeq`` is terminated by a ``yamlEndSeq`` and every
    ## ``yamlStartDoc`` is terminated by a ``yamlEndDoc``. Moreover, every
    ## emitted mapping has an even number of children.
    ##
    ## The creator of a ``YamlStream`` is responsible for it being
    ## well-formed. A user of the stream may assume that it is well-formed
    ## and is not required to check for it. The procs in this module will
    ## always yield a well-formed ``YamlStream`` and expect it to be
    ## well-formed if they take it as input parameter.
